# Homemade-Server
This repository contains files that were uploaded to my home server that I created from a PC that was laying around. This website was developed for a small family business to allow email notifications when a customer was interested in it's services. The server OS was Windows Server 2016. Currently this website is not avaiable publicly until it is reviewed for stainablility.
